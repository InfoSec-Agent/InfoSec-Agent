# InfoSec Agent

The InfoSec Agent project aims to improve the security and privacy of computer users. Currently, there are applications available that do this, but they are mainly targeted at large companies. The goal of this project is to make this accessible to everyone. An application is being developed that collects information about the user's system to discover any security or privacy vulnerabilities. The results will be presented to the user in a special dashboard, showing the current status of the system, including recommended actions to improve it.

This project is made possible with the support of the SIDN Fund.
